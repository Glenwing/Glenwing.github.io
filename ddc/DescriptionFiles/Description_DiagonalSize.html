<div>
    This is the display's diagonal measurement. This is the figure typically marketed as the "size" of a display. It is the length along the display panel between two opposing corners.<br><br>

    Note that the diagonal size of a display is often rounded. "24-inch" displays for example are commonly 23.6, 23.8, 24.0, or 24.1 inches. "22-inch" displays are usually 21.5 inches, and "32-inch" displays are often 31.5 inches, and so on.<br><br>

    To ensure accurate calculation results, it is recommended to double-check the size of the display, and find a source (preferably the manufacturer's website) that gives at least 1 decimal place of precision.
