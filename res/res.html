            This utility attempts to determine your screen resolution. <span class='error'>There is no way for any web-based utility like this to be completely foolproof</span> because it is dependent on information provided by the browser. There is no direct access to system information. You should check your screen resolution from system settings rather than a website if possible.
        </p>

        <p>
            Your screen resolution has been detected as:

            Your browser rendering engine has been detected as <b>Blink</b>, the engine used by Chrome, Opera, and Edge. <span class='warning'>Blink-based browsers may give incorrect results<span id='uncertainty_Blink_2' style='display:none;'> beyond the given uncertainty range</span></span> if additional browser utilities are docked on the sides, such as the developer console or the Opera sidebar, or due to a myriad of other circumstances like having using browser zoom in a non-maximized window or running the browser in <code>F11</code> fullscreen mode. For highest confidence, Firefox is recommended.

        <div id='scaledRes_Blink' style='display:none'>
            <p>
                Your system is configured with <b id='textFill_Blink_1'>[scale]</b> scaling, which gives you desktop space equivalent to a display with a resolution of:
            </p> 

            <div id='textFill_Blink_2' class='res smallResult'></div>

            <p>
                Other resolution detection websites may incorrectly report that number as the screen resolution because they do not account for the system scaling which is used on many modern machines such as Apple "retina display" computers, mobile devices, and Windows computers with high-density displays.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p id='uncertainty_Blink' style='display:none;'>
            On devices with large scaling ratios (particularly mobile devices), the given result may deviate slightly from the true resolution of the display due to rounding errors in the information provided by the browser. An uncertainty range is provided, which represents the maximum possible deviation due to rounding errors. The true resolution could be anywhere inside this range.
        </p>
        <p>
            Determining true resolution is difficult in Blink-based browsers. The CSS pixel scaling ratio reported by the browser, <code>window.devicePixelRatio</code>, is the OS system scale and the browser zoom level combined. However, in Blink-based browsers, the effective screen resolution <code>window.screen.width</code> is affected by system scaling only, not by zoom level, so multiplying the reported screen width by the total pixel scaling ratio will yield an incorrect result if the browser zoom is not at 100%.
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead, in Blink-based browsers the screen resolution must be determined using <code>window.innerWidth</code> and <code>window.outerWidth</code>. The <code>innerWidth</code> is affected by the zoom level while the <code>outerWidth</code> is not, so the ratio of these values will give the browser zoom level which can then be removed from the CSS pixel ratio to determine the OS scaling ratio alone. The width of the screen can then be calculated by multiplying <code>window.screen.width</code> with the OS scaling ratio.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, this can lead to other inaccuracies, since <code>innerWidth</code> and <code>outerWidth</code>, in addition to introducing further rounding error, are also affected by various other circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, the value of <code>outerWidth</code> increases to include the drop-shadow behind the window when the browser is not maximized on Windows (this utility compensates for the difference with a hard-coded value when the OS is using 100% scaling, but there is no way to make a universal solution).
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, both values expand when the browser is set to fullscreen mode, but <code>innerWidth</code> actually becomes larger than <code>outerWidth</code> for some unknown reason. The <code>innerWidth</code> value is also affected by docked interfaces like the developer console or the Opera sidebar. Any of these conditions can cause the result to become inaccurate.

        <p>
            Your browser rendering engine has been detected as <b id='textFill_Gecko_1'>[engine]</b>, the engine used by <span id='textFill_Gecko_2'>[browser]</span>.
        </p>
        <div id='scaledRes_Gecko' style='display:none;'>
            <p>
                Your system is configured with <b id='textFill_Gecko_3'>[scale]</b> total system scaling and browser zoom, which gives you desktop space equivalent to a display with a resolution of:

            <div id='textFill_Gecko_4' class='res smallResult'></div>

            <p>
                Other resolution detection websites may incorrectly report that number as the screen resolution because they do not account for the system scaling which is used on many modern machines such as Apple "retina display" computers, mobile devices, and Windows computers with high-density displays.

            The given result may deviate slightly from the true resolution of the display due to rounding errors in the information provided by the browser. An uncertainty range is provided, which represents the maximum possible deviation. The true resolution could be anywhere inside this range.
        </p>
        <p>
            The screen resolution is determined by reading the <code>window.screen.width</code> property provided by the browser. This gives the "equivalent resolution" with scaling applied. The browser also gives the scaling ratio used by the system, <code>window.devicePixelRatio</code>. Multiplying these values gives the original screen resolution (although with potential rounding errors).
